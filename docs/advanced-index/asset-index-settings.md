# Asset Index Settings Guide

The Asset Index Settings allow you to customize how your asset list is displayed. These settings help you optimize your workflow by showing exactly the information you need in the way you need it.

## Column Configuration

### Managing Columns

- **Fixed Columns**: 'Name' is always the first column and cannot be removed
- **Built-in Columns**:
  - ID
  - QR ID
  - Status
  - Description
  - Value
  - Available to Book
  - Created At
  - Category
  - Tags
  - Location
  - Kit
  - Custody
- **Custom Field Columns**: Any custom fields you've created appear after built-in columns

### Showing/Hiding Columns

1. Click the 'Columns' button in the top right of the asset list
2. Use checkboxes to toggle column visibility
3. Changes apply immediately after clicking "Apply"
4. Your configuration is saved per user and organization

### Reordering Columns

1. Open the column configuration menu
2. Drag and drop columns using the handle icon (⋮⋮)
3. New order is saved automatically
4. Changes persist across sessions

### Column Groups

Columns are organized into two groups:

1. **Fixed Columns**: Always visible (Name)
2. **Configurable Columns**: Can be shown/hidden and reordered

## Freezing First Column

The freeze column feature keeps the first column visible while scrolling horizontally through a wide table.

### How to Enable/Disable

1. Click the settings menu in the asset list
2. Toggle "Freeze first column"
3. Setting is saved per user

### Benefits

## Asset Image Display

Control whether thumbnail images appear next to asset names.

### Configuring Image Display

1. Access the asset list settings
2. Find "Show asset images"
3. Toggle the setting on/off

### Image Display Rules

### Performance Considerations
