# Hooks

Shelf comes with a few utility hooks that will make your usage of shelf easier.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all hooks are documented. If you find a hook that is missing in the documentation, feel free to add your contribution by explaining what the hook does, using the same formatting as we typically use.

## useViewportHeight

The `useViewportHeight` hook is a utility hook that provides the current viewport height, excluding the URL bar, in pixels. This is useful for creating full-screen experiences on mobile devices where the URL bar can show and hide dynamically.

The hook returns an object with two properties:

- `vh`: The current viewport height in pixels.
- `isMd`: A boolean indicating whether the viewport width is at least 768px.

### Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `useViewportHeight` hook:

```typescriptreact
import { useViewportHeight } from './useViewportHeight'; // adjust the path as needed

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { vh, isMd } = useViewportHeight();
  const height = isMd ? vh - 132 : vh - 167;

  return (
    <div style={{ height: `${height}px` }}>
      {/* Your content here */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## useFetcherWithReset

The `useFetcherWithReset` hook is a utility hook that extends the functionality of the `useFetcher` hook from Remix. It provides a `reset` function that allows you to manually reset the data fetched by the fetcher.

The hook returns an object that includes all properties of the original fetcher, plus a `reset` function and a `data` property of a specified type.

### Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `useFetcherWithReset` hook:

```typescript
import useFetcherWithReset from './useFetcherWithReset'; // adjust the path as needed

const MyComponent = () => {
  const fetcher = useFetcherWithReset<MyDataType>();

  const handleReset = () => {
    fetcher.reset();
  };

  // Use fetcher to fetch data...

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Display fetched data */}
      <button onClick={handleReset}>Reset data</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## useBookingStatus

The `useBookingStatus` hook is a utility hook that provides various status flags related to a booking. It's useful for determining the current state of a booking and the presence of certain types of assets within the booking.

The hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `hasAssets`: A boolean indicating whether the booking has any assets.
- `hasUnavailableAssets`: A boolean indicating whether the booking has any assets that are currently unavailable.
- `isDraft`: A boolean indicating whether the booking is in the draft state.
- `isReserved`: A boolean indicating whether the booking is in the reserved state.
- `isOngoing`: A boolean indicating whether the booking is ongoing.
- `isCompleted`: A boolean indicating whether the booking has been completed.
- `isArchived`: A boolean indicating whether the booking has been archived.
- `isOverdue`: A boolean indicating whether the booking is overdue.
- `isCancelled`: A boolean indicating whether the booking has been cancelled.
- `hasCheckedOutAssets`: A boolean indicating whether any assets in the booking have been checked out.
- `hasAlreadyBookedAssets`: A boolean indicating whether any assets in the booking have been booked previously.
- `hasAssetsInCustody`: A boolean indicating whether any assets in the booking are currently in custody.

### Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `useBookingStatus` hook:

```typescript
import useBookingStatus from './useBookingStatus'; // adjust the path as needed

const MyComponent = ({ booking }) => {
  const bookingStatus = useBookingStatus(booking);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Display booking status */}
      {bookingStatus.isReserved && <div>The booking is reserved.</div>}
    </div>
  );
};
```
