# Docker

> [!NOTE]
> The Docker configuration for shelf.nu is an effort powered by people within the community, done by [@anatolinicolae](https://github.com/anatolinicolae). Shelf Asset Management Inc. does not yet provide official support for Docker, but we will accept fixes and documentation at this time. Use at your own risk.

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to run shelf via docker, there are still some prerequisites you need to meet. Because our docker setup doesn't currently support self-hosting supabase, you need to complete the steps below. This means you have to take care of setting up your Supabase environment, running migrations against your database, and making sure Supabase is configured based on our requirements.

1. [Get Started > Development](./get-started.md#development)
2. [Get Started > Authentication](./get-started.md#authentication)

This will make sure you have a DATABASE that you are ready to connect to.

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine
2. Use the `docker run` command and replace your env varibales:
   ```sh
   docker run -d \
     --name "shelf" \
     -e "DATABASE_URL=postgres://{USER}:{PASSWORD}@{HOST}:6543/{DB_NAME}?pgbouncer=true" \
     -e "DIRECT_URL=postgres://{USER}:{PASSWORD}@{HOST}:5432/{DB_NAME}" \
     -e 'SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC=ANON_PUBLIC' \
     -e 'SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=SERVICE_ROLE' \
     -e 'SUPABASE_URL=https://{YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME}.supabase.co' \
     -e 'SESSION_SECRET=super-duper-s3cret' \
     -e 'SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000' \
     -e 'MAPTILER_TOKEN=maptiler-token' \
     -e 'SMTP_HOST=mail.example.com' \
     -e 'SMTP_USER=some-email@example.com' \
     -e 'SMTP_FROM="Carlos from shelf.nu" <carlos@shelf.nu>' \
     -e 'SMTP_PWD=super-safe-passw0rd' \
     -e 'INVITE_TOKEN_SECRET=another-super-duper-s3cret' \
     -p 3000:8080 \
     --restart unless-stopped \
     ghcr.io/shelf-nu/shelf.nu:latest
   ```
   > [!NOTE] > `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` are mandatory when using Supabase Cloud. Learn more in [Get Started > Development](./get-started.md#development) section.

## Development

> [!CAUTION]
> During development involving Dockerfile changes, make sure to **address the correct Dockerfile** in your builds:
>
> - Fly.io will be built via `Dockerfile`
> - ghcr.io will be built via `Dockerfile.image`

By default both Fly.io and Docker will build via `Dockerfile` unless specifically instructed. Learn more [about Fly.io Config](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/#specify-a-dockerfile) and [Docker image builds](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/build/#file).

In order to build a local Docker image just as the one we provide for self-hosting, you'll have to build `Dockerfile.image` using buildx as follows:

```sh
docker buildx build \
   --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 `# use --platform to instruct x86 and ARM build` \
   --tag shelf-local \
   --file Dockerfile.image .
```

Then running the locally-built image should be as simple as:

```sh
docker run -d \
   --name "shelf" \
   -e ... `# your env vars` \
   shelf-local
```

### ARM processors

You can also run shelf on ARM64 processors.

1. Linux / Pine A64

   ```sh
   root@DietPi:~#
   docker run -it --rm --entrypoint /usr/bin/uname ghcr.io/shelf-nu/shelf.nu:latest -a
   Linux 77ae434f8fe9 6.1.63-current-sunxi64 #1 SMP Mon Nov 20 10:52:19 UTC 2023 aarch64 GNU/Linux
   ```

2. MacOS / M1 Max
   ```sh
   ‚ùØ ~
   docker run -it --rm --platform linux/arm64 --entrypoint /usr/bin/uname ghcr.io/shelf-nu/shelf.nu:latest -a
   Linux 7a9dff819847 6.5.13-orbstack-00122-g57b8027e2387 #1 SMP Tue Feb  6 07:48:26 UTC 2024 aarch64 GNU/Linux
   ```
