             suggesting rental/inventory-only items without direct purchase pricing.

4. discountable
   Type: Boolean
   Sample: TRUE
   Decision: Keep as-is
   Rationale: Business logic flag indicating if item can have discounts applied.
             All samples are TRUE, but header is needed for future flexibility.

16. price_ruleset
    Type: String (Empty in all samples)
    Sample: (empty)
    Decision: Keep as-is
    Rationale: Reference to pricing rules/tiers. Empty suggests flat pricing or rental-only
              model. Placeholder for future dynamic pricing features.

17. tags
    Type: String (Comma-separated)
    Sample: "electronics,display,barcode_test,prodstud-rental,prodstud"
    Decision: Keep as-is
    Rationale: Flexible categorization and filtering system. Tags like "prodstud-rental"

              Essential for search and filtering functionality.

18. barcode
    Type: String (Numeric or URL)
    Sample: "7543910390593", "https://bqbl.it/1a6fc3d9-dfd8-4750-9037-6fb447d8158f"
    Decision: Keep as-is
    Rationale: Barcode/QR code identifier. Can be numeric barcode or URL to QR code.
              Critical for scanning and quick asset lookup. Mixed format suggests
              system evolution or multiple barcode types.

              and asset lifecycle management. Empty for some items suggests optional
              or unknown purchase dates.

27. vendor
    Type: String
    Sample: "Amazon", "Thomann", "Martin Limbach"

              for future usage categorization.

34. warranty_date
    Type: Date (Empty in all samples)
    Sample: (empty)
    Decision: Keep as-is
    Rationale: Warranty expiration date. Empty suggests either no warranty, expired
              warranty, or data not tracked. Important for maintenance planning
              when populated.

KEY DECISIONS SUMMARY
=====================

1. KEEP ALL 34 HEADERS: Even empty fields serve as placeholders for future data or
   represent optional information that may exist for some products.

2. DELIMITER: Semicolon (;) is correct choice as product descriptions contain commas
   and complex text that would break CSV parsing with comma delimiter.

3. DATA REDUNDANCY: Multiple price representations (formatted, decimal, cents) is
   intentional and follows financial best practices:
   - Formatted for display
   - Decimal for human-readable calculations
   - Cents/integer for precise system calculations

4. EMPTY FIELDS: Not all fields populated for all products. This is acceptable as:
   - Some are optional (warranty_date, product_website)
   - Some are system placeholders (usage_type, tax_category)
   - Some depend on item type (stock_identifier only for non-bulk items)

5. BOOLEAN vs. ENUM: Fields like 'discountable', 'taxable', 'bulk' use TRUE/FALSE
   (boolean), while 'status' and 'price_type' use strings (enum) - this suggests
   simple binary choices vs. multiple possible states.

6. UUID vs. STRING IDs: UUIDs used for system IDs (id, product_group_id), while
   human-readable strings used for business IDs (sku, stock_identifier).

7. HTML IN CSV: Description field contains HTML. This is acceptable as:
   - Properly escaped/quoted in CSV
   - Allows rich formatting in application
   - Standard practice for content management systems

RECOMMENDED IMPORT MAPPING
===========================

For shelf.nu asset import, this CSV structure maps to the Asset model with:
- Core fields: id, name, sku, description, location
- Inventory: quantity, bulk, stock_identifier, available, status
- Financial: base_price_*, deposit_*, taxable, tax_category
- Categorization: product_group_id, tags
- Procurement: vendor, vendor_art_nr, purchase_price, date_of_purchase
- Tracking: barcode, storage_room
- Business logic: discountable, price_type, price_ruleset, usage_type

All headers are valid and serve specific business purposes in the Shelf.nu
asset management system.
