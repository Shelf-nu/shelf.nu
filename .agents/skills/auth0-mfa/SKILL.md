# Auth0 MFA Guide

Add Multi-Factor Authentication to protect user accounts and require additional verification for sensitive operations.

---

## Overview

### What is MFA?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requires users to provide two or more verification factors to access their accounts. Auth0 supports multiple MFA factors and enables step-up authentication for sensitive operations.

### When to Use This Skill

- Adding MFA to protect user accounts
- Requiring additional verification for sensitive actions (payments, settings changes)
- Implementing adaptive/risk-based authentication
- Meeting compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, SOC2, HIPAA)

### MFA Factors Supported

| Factor        | Type                   | Description                                                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| TOTP          | Something you have     | Time-based one-time passwords (Google Authenticator, Authy) |
| SMS           | Something you have     | One-time codes via text message                             |
| Email         | Something you have     | One-time codes via email                                    |
| Push          | Something you have     | Push notifications via Auth0 Guardian app                   |
| WebAuthn      | Something you have/are | Security keys, biometrics, passkeys                         |
| Voice         | Something you have     | One-time codes via phone call                               |
| Recovery Code | Backup                 | One-time use recovery codes                                 |

### Key Concepts

| Concept      | Description                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `acr_values` | Request MFA during authentication                                   |
| `amr` claim  | Authentication Methods Reference - indicates how user authenticated |
| Step-up auth | Require MFA for specific actions after initial login                |
| Adaptive MFA | Conditionally require MFA based on risk signals                     |

## Step 1: Enable MFA in Tenant

### Via Auth0 Dashboard

1. Go to **Security → Multi-factor Auth**
2. Enable desired factors (TOTP, SMS, etc.)
3. Configure **Policies**:
   - **Always** - Require MFA for all logins
   - **Adaptive** - Risk-based MFA
   - **Never** - Disable MFA (use step-up instead)

### Via Auth0 CLI

```bash
# View current MFA configuration
auth0 api get "guardian/factors"

# Enable TOTP (One-time Password)
auth0 api put "guardian/factors/otp" --data '{"enabled": true}'

# Enable SMS
auth0 api put "guardian/factors/sms" --data '{"enabled": true}'

# Enable Push notifications
auth0 api put "guardian/factors/push-notification" --data '{"enabled": true}'

# Enable WebAuthn (Roaming - Security Keys)
auth0 api put "guardian/factors/webauthn-roaming" --data '{"enabled": true}'

# Enable WebAuthn (Platform - Biometrics)
auth0 api put "guardian/factors/webauthn-platform" --data '{"enabled": true}'

# Enable Email
auth0 api put "guardian/factors/email" --data '{"enabled": true}'
```

### Configure MFA Policy

```bash
# Set MFA policy: "all-applications" or "confidence-score"
auth0 api patch "guardian/policies" --data '["all-applications"]'
```

---

## Step 2: Implement Step-Up Authentication

Step-up auth requires MFA for sensitive operations without requiring it for every login.

### The `acr_values` Parameter

Request MFA by including `acr_values` in your authorization request:

```
acr_values=http://schemas.openid.net/pape/policies/2007/06/multi-factor
```

### Implementation Pattern

The general pattern for all frameworks:

1. Check if user has already completed MFA (inspect `amr` claim)
2. If not, request MFA via `acr_values` parameter
3. Proceed with sensitive action once MFA is verified

**For complete framework-specific examples, see [Examples Guide](references/examples.md):**

- React (basic and custom hook)
- Next.js (App Router)
- Vue.js
- Angular
