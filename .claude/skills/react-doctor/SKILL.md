# React Doctor

Scans React codebases for security, performance, correctness, and architecture issues. Outputs a 0–100 health score.

## After making React code changes:

Run `npx -y react-doctor@latest . --verbose --diff` and check the score did not regress.

If the score dropped, fix the regressions before committing.

## For general cleanup or code improvement:

Run `npx -y react-doctor@latest . --verbose` (without `--diff`) to scan the full codebase. Fix issues by severity — errors first, then warnings.

## Command

```bash
npx -y react-doctor@latest . --verbose --diff
```
