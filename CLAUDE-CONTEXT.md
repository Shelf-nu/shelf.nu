## What was built

### Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)

**Schema:**

- Added `AssetType` (INDIVIDUAL/QUANTITY_TRACKED), `ConsumptionType` (ONE_WAY/TWO_WAY), `ConsumptionCategory` (CHECKOUT/RETURN/RESTOCK/ADJUSTMENT/LOSS) enums
- Added quantity fields to Asset: `type`, `quantity`, `minQuantity`, `consumptionType`, `unitOfMeasure`, `assetModelId`
- Created `AssetModel` entity (template/grouping for assets) with default category/valuation
- Created `ConsumptionLog` model for audit trail (used in Phase 2)
- Created `BookingAsset` explicit pivot table (coexists with implicit M2M — Phase 3 will do the rename migration)
- `availableQuantity` is NOT stored — computed at service layer (Decision #7)

**AssetModel CRUD:**

- Service: `app/modules/asset-model/service.server.ts`
- Routes under `settings.asset-models.*` (Settings > Workspace Settings > Asset Models)
- Full-page Card-based create/edit forms with DynamicSelect for default category
- Inline creation dialog on the asset form (like categories)
- Bulk delete with filter awareness (ALL_SELECTED_KEY respects search params)
- Delete dialog shows asset count warning

**Asset form:**

- Tracking method selector (radio cards: "Individually tracked" / "Tracked by quantity")
- Quantity fields appear below Name, above Asset ID when "Tracked by quantity" selected
- Consumption type uses Popover-based dropdown
- Asset Model DynamicSelect with default category auto-selection via search params
- Server-side validation for quantity-tracked assets

**Asset detail page:**

- QuantityOverviewCard in right sidebar showing computed total/available/inCustody
- Low Stock badge when available ≤ minQuantity
- Asset model link (permission-gated)

**Asset list:**

- QTY badge next to quantity-tracked asset names
- Quantity column in both simple and advanced views
- Tracking method and Asset model columns in advanced view
- Filters: quantity (number type), tracking type (enum), asset model (enum with DynamicSelect)
- Sort support for type, quantity, assetModel columns

### Phase 2: Quantity-Aware Custody & Consumption (COMPLETED)

**Schema migration:**

- Custody model: removed `@unique` on `assetId`, added `quantity Int @default(1)`, added `@@unique([assetId, teamMemberId])`
- Asset.custody changed from `Custody?` to `Custody[]` (one-to-many)
- Database trigger `custody_individual_asset_check` enforces single custodian for INDIVIDUAL assets
- 30+ files updated with `getPrimaryCustody()` and `hasCustody()` helpers from `app/modules/custody/utils.ts`

**ConsumptionLog service:** `app/modules/consumption-log/service.server.ts`

- `createConsumptionLog()` — with optional transaction client
- `getConsumptionLogs()` — paginated history
- `computeAvailableQuantity()` — `{ total, inCustody, available }` via `Promise.all`
- `adjustQuantity()` — transactional with `SELECT FOR UPDATE` row locking

**Concurrency:** `app/modules/consumption-log/quantity-lock.server.ts`

- `lockAssetForQuantityUpdate()` — PostgreSQL `SELECT FOR UPDATE` within Prisma transaction

**Quantity custody:** `app/modules/asset/service.server.ts`

- `checkOutQuantity()` — lock → validate → upsert custody → log CHECKOUT
- `releaseQuantity()` — lock → validate → delete/decrement custody → log RETURN
- Routes: `api+/assets.assign-quantity-custody.ts`, `api+/assets.release-quantity-custody.ts`
- UI: `QuantityCustodyDialog`, `QuantityCustodyList` (sidebar card with per-custodian release)

**Quick-adjust:** `api+/assets.adjust-quantity.ts`

- `QuickAdjustDialog` — Add (RESTOCK) / Remove (LOSS) with note
- Integrated into QuantityOverviewCard ("Adjust" button)
- Auto-opens after QR scan for quantity-tracked assets

**Low-stock notifications:** `app/modules/consumption-log/low-stock.server.ts`

- In-app notification via `sendNotification()`
- Email alert to org owner via React Email template (`app/emails/low-stock-alert.tsx`)
- Triggered after checkouts and subtractive adjustments

**QuantityOverviewCard:** Computed real values from custody aggregation. Shows `available / total` with Low Stock badge.

## Key Decisions (from PRD)

1. `availableQuantity` computed, not stored (Decision #7)
2. Custody partial unique index → replaced with DB trigger (PostgreSQL doesn't allow subqueries in partial index predicates)
3. `ConsumptionLog.quantity` always positive, direction from category (Decision #9)
4. BookingAsset migration deferred to Phase 3 using safe rename strategy (Decision #10)
5. Concurrency via `SELECT FOR UPDATE` row locking within `db.$transaction()`
6. `Custody?` → `Custody[]` with `getPrimaryCustody()` helper for backward compat
7. Asset model names are NOT unique per org (allow duplicates)

---

## What's next: Phase 3 — Booking Integration

**Goal:** Quantity-aware bookings and book-by-model.

**Prerequisites (from PRD):**

- Open Question #2: Availability communication between booking and checkout
- Open Question #5: BookingAsset schema for book-by-model (assetModelId on BookingAsset)

**Key items:**

- Migrate `_AssetToBooking` → `BookingAsset` using rename strategy (ALTER TABLE RENAME — metadata-only, no data copy)
- Rewire 18 raw SQL queries in `asset/query.server.ts` + ~60 Prisma relation usages
- Quantity-tracked booking: reserve N units
- Availability formula: `Available = Total − In custody − Reserved`
- Book-by-model: reserve N from an AssetModel
- Scan-to-assign at checkout for model-level bookings
- Partial check-in with consumption reports (returnable assets)

## Phase 4 — Kit, Location, and Auxiliary

- Kit integration with quantity-tracked items
- Location split/merge for quantity-tracked assets (pending design)
- Model grouping tool
- Import/export with quantity columns

---

## Migrations applied

1. `20260331101357_add_asset_model_and_quantity_based_fields` — Phase 1 schema
2. `20260401113301_add_index_to_asset_models` — Index on AssetModel
3. `20260403135852_add_quantity_based_custody_fields` — Custody quantity + composite unique
4. `20260403140000_add_custody_individual_unique_trigger` — DB trigger for individual asset single custody

---

## PR Review rounds

Three rounds of CodeRabbit/Copilot review feedback were addressed:

- Bulk delete filter awareness
- Delete dialog disabled states
- Custody permission checks
- Number filter SQL type casting
- Sort mappings for new columns
- Server-side error fallbacks on forms
- Low-stock email notifications

All review threads resolved on the PR.

## Known Issues

### Duplicate rows in advanced asset index for multi-custodian quantity assets

**Problem:** When a quantity-tracked asset has multiple custody records (multiple
custodians), it shows as duplicate rows in the advanced index view. This is because
the raw SQL query in `asset/query.server.ts` does a `LEFT JOIN` on `Custody` and
the `GROUP BY` includes `cu.id`, so each custody record produces a separate row.

**Root cause:** `assetQueryJoins` (line 1866) joins custody 1:1 per row, and the
`GROUP BY` in `service.server.ts` (line 907) groups by `cu.id, tm.name, u.id, ...`
— grouping per custody record instead of per asset.

**Fix needed:** Replace the direct custody LEFT JOIN with a lateral subquery or
correlated subquery that aggregates all custody records into a single JSON array
per asset. This way each asset produces exactly one row regardless of how many
custodians it has. The custody column in the index should show multiple custodians
(e.g., "Project Engineer (4), Self Service (7)") rather than duplicating the row.

**Files to change:**

- `app/modules/asset/query.server.ts` — `assetQueryJoins` and custody CASE block
- `app/modules/asset/service.server.ts` — GROUP BY clause (remove `cu.id`, `tm.name`, `u.id`, etc.)
- Asset index UI components — custody column renderer to handle multiple custodians

### Kit custody assigns only 1 unit for quantity-tracked assets

**Problem:** When a quantity-tracked asset is added to a kit that already
has custody, the inherited custody record is created with `quantity: 1`
(the default) instead of the asset's full tracked quantity. The asset
gets marked `IN_CUSTODY` while only 1 unit is actually assigned.

**Files to change:**

- `app/modules/kit/service.server.ts` — the `custody.create` inside
  `assetsToInheritStatus` map (~line 2256) needs to set `quantity`
  from the asset's tracked amount

### Kit removal wipes all custody for quantity-tracked assets

**Problem:** Removing a quantity-tracked asset from an in-custody kit
deletes ALL custody rows via `custody: { deleteMany: {} }` and forces
`AVAILABLE` status. This erases unrelated quantity custody allocations
that have nothing to do with the kit.

**Files to change:**

- `app/routes/_layout+/kits.$kitId.tsx` (~line 297) — needs a
  quantity-aware release path that only removes the kit-related
  custody record, not all of them
