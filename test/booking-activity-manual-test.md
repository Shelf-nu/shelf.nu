### 8. Archive Booking Activity

### 9. Manual Note Creation

2. Type a manual note in the note input field

**Steps**:

1. Create a manual note (as per test 9)
2. Click actions dropdown on the note
3. Select "Delete"
4. Confirm deletion

**Expected Result**: Note should be removed from activity list

### 11. Permissions Testing

**Objective**: Verify that permissions work correctly
**Steps**:

1. Login with user that has bookingNote read permissions
2. Navigate to booking activity tab
3. Verify can see notes
4. Login with user without bookingNote permissions
5. Navigate to booking activity tab

**Expected Result**:

- User with permissions should see activity and note creation form
- User without permissions should see "Insufficient permissions" message

### 12. Activity Timeline Order

**Objective**: Verify that activity notes are displayed in correct chronological order
**Steps**:

1. Perform multiple actions on a booking (reserve, add assets, check-in, add manual note)
2. Check Activity tab

**Expected Result**: All activities should be listed with most recent first, showing correct timestamps

## Expected UI Elements

### Activity Tab

- Should be accessible from booking detail page
- Should show chronological list of activities
- Should distinguish between system-generated (UPDATE) and manual (COMMENT) notes
- Should show user names and timestamps for all activities
- Should provide note creation form for users with proper permissions

### Note Display

- System notes should show just timestamp and content
- Manual notes should show timestamp, user name, and actions dropdown
- Content should support markdown formatting
- Each note should have appropriate styling based on type

## Security Considerations

- Users should only be able to delete their own manual notes
- System-generated notes should not be deletable
- Activity should only be visible to users with proper permissions
- Cross-organization access should be prevented

## Performance Considerations

- Activity loading should be reasonably fast
- Large number of activities should not impact page performance significantly
- Note creation should provide immediate feedback (optimistic UI)
