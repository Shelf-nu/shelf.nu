/**
 * BOOKING ACTIVITY LOG SERVICE
 *
 * This service manages booking activity logs similar to the asset notes system.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 * - BookingNote model mirrors the existing Note model structure
 * - Supports two note types: COMMENT (manual user notes) and UPDATE (system-generated activity)
 * - Organization isolation via booking relationship
 * - Indexed on bookingId and userId for efficient queries
 *
 * SECURITY:
 * - Notes are scoped to organization via booking relationship
 * - Only note creators can delete their manual notes
 * - System-generated notes cannot be deleted (userId is null)
 * - All operations require proper permissions (bookingNote.read/create)
 *
 * ACTIVITY TRACKING:
 * - Status changes (DRAFTâ†’RESERVED, cancellation, archival)
 * - Detail updates (name, description, dates, custodian changes)
 * - Asset management (additions, removals)
 * - Check-in/check-out operations (full and partial)
 *
 * MESSAGE FORMAT:
 * - System messages use markdown formatting for consistency
 * - Links to related entities: **[Booking Name](/bookings/id)**
 * - Bold text for emphasis: **User Name**, **Asset Count**
 */
